![Cats on Synths in SPACE!!!](/cat_synth_space.png)


(Demo of final patch)

Why are synthesizers interesting?
+ Basic systems combined in interesting ways - modular synthesis
+ Music from tech
+ Very easy to reproduce and understand in software

Why build them in software?
+ Not for performance - for creative coding
+ Interactive sound generation

What we are going to do today?
+ Start with fundamentals
+ Skip the boring and technical parts by using pre made blocks
+ Incrementally build towards final analog synth (as far as we can)

What is MaxMSP?
(forbidden planet example)
+ Difference between Max, MSP, Jitter, and Beap
+ Highlight other areas of Max and what its traditionally used for
+ We are going to bite of a chunk of Max - analog synthesis

== Example Patches from Repo ==
(each patch is half done - finishing it is the point of the workshop)

Patch 01 - Make some noise!
+ plug VCO1 into output and turn it on
+ use constant note source for frequency

Patch 02 - Add a keyboard
+ plug in keyboard
+ add scope so we can see timbre

Patch 03 - Dueling Oscillators
+ add in VCO2 and mix them

What is Subtractive Synthesis
+ Ability to shape sound through filters and envelopes
+ Additive synthesis takes opposite approach
+ Take all the harmonics and diminish the ones you don't want
+ This is the whole point of synths

Patch 04 - Add a filter
+ LPF with cutoff and resonance control
+ Demonstrate cutoff sweep manually

Wrap
+ Final patch is included
+ Show how to dig into sub modules - how the sausage was made
