Demo
+ Show interesting patch that demonstrates what you can do when things get more advanced
+ Use physical hardware with MaxMSP


Why are synthesizers interesting?
+ Basic systems combined in interesting ways
+ Music from tech
+ Very easy to reproduce and understand in software


What we are going to do today?
+ Start with fundamentals
+ Skip the boring parts by using Beap
+ Incrementally build towards a basic analog synth


What is MaxMSP?
+ Difference between Max, MSP, and Beap
+ Highlight other areas of Max and what its traditionally used for
+ We are going to bite of a chunk of Max - analog synthesis

Patch 01 - Build a sine wave oscillator
+ slider based

Patch 02 - Make into a sawtooth oscillator
+ plug in keyboard
+ add scope so we can see timbre

What is Subtractive Synthesis
+ Ability to shape sound through filters and envelopes
+ Additive synthesis takes opposite approach

Patch 03 - Welcome to Beap
Patch 04-08 - build out analog synth piece by piece with students following along

Patch 09 - finished synth
+ with some embelishments student can figure out later
+ should be fun to play

Wrap
+ What else can you do for next steps (show examples)
  - do them in hardware
  - use max to interface with the outside?
